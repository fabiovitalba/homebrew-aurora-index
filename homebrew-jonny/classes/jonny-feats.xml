			<p>Since you've been infected with the Vampire pleague, you gain the following benefits</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Your Dexterity score increases by 2 and your Charisma score increases by 1, to a maximum of 16.</li>
                <li>Your creature type changes to undead. Spells and abilities that state effects or conditions specifically regarding Undead of a specific CR have no effect on you.</li>
				<li>If a spell or ability other than your own would cause you to gain Hit Points, you gain that many temporary Hit Points instead. If you are reduced to 0 hit points and fall unconscious as a result, any healing you receive will stabilize you and leave you on 1 hit point and unconscious.</li>
				<li>Furthermore, you cannot die from old age and you do not require air, food or drink.</li>
			</ul>
