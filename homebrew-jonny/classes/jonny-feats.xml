			<p>You have become possessed by the thirst that grips all Vampires. In combat, this thirst drives you into an insatiable frenzy of bloodshed. Whenever you deal combat damage with an unarmed strike or a melee/ranged weapon to a target that can bleed, and is not undead or a construct, you gain one Fury Point. You may only have a maximum of 4 Fury Points at any time. Upon completing a short or long rest, the number of Fury Points you have is reset to 0. These points are used by certain abilities that you can learn through your transformation levels.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can spend Fury Points (FP) to use the following abilities:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Fanged Bite (1FP).</b> Bonus Action, Special unarmed Bite Attack. 1d4 + STR/DEX.</li>
				<li><b>Calculated Strike (1FP).</b> On a melee weapon attack hit add 1d6 Damage. No Fury Points are generated.</li>
				<li><b>Vampiric Mist (2FP).</b> Bonus Action, Teleport up to 30 ft. to an unoccupied space you can see.</li>
				<li><b>Unearthly Reflexes (1FP).</b> After a DEX Saving Throw, before the Result is determined. Use reaction to take half or no Damage.</li>

			<p>Your appearance has greatly altered from its original features. The first signs were the fangs that started to protrude from your upper row of teeth. You have no reflection in mirrors or other reflective surfaces. With dry, pale skin and occasional burns from the sun, you can hide your true appearance by concentrating on your pre-vampirism appearance. However, the following situations can reveal your true appearance:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Concentrating on a spell.</li>
				<li>Gaining the unconscious condition.</li>
				<li>Entering hallowed ground.</li>
				<li>Taking damage from being exposed to sunlight or free-flowing water.</li>
				<li>Choosing to reveal your true self.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In events of extreme emotional or physical stress, a GM may call for a Constitution saving throw with a DC of their choosing to see if you maintain your humanoid form.</p>

			<description>Your appearance is now greatly altered. In order to maintain your old appearance you have to concentrate.</description>
