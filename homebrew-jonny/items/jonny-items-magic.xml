	<element name="Tome of the Raven Queen" type="Magic Item" source="Homebrew (Jonny)" id="ID_HB_JONNY_ITEM_MAGIC_TOMEOFTHERAVENQUEEN">
		<description>
			<p>This thick leather-bound volume has a black raven feather pinned on the front cover. If you can attune to this item, you can use it as a spellbook and an arcane focus. In addition, while holding the tome, you can use a bonus action to cast a spell you have written in this tome, without expending a spell slot or using any verbal or somatic components. Once used, this property of the tome can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">While holding this tome you can cast the <em>wall of fire</em> spell.</p>
			<p class="indent">While attuned to the book, you can remove the feather from the book's cover. If you do so, all spells written in the book are permanently ereased.</p>
			<p class="indent">The Raven Queen watches anyone using this tome. She can also write cryptic messages in the book. These messages appear at midnight and fade away after they are read.</p>

			<p>Through an intricate ritual you were able to create this gem. This gem allows to store up to 50 hp of healing. To gain or use stored healing, you have to be linked to this gem.</p>
			<p>When getting healing you can decide to pass it through this healing catalyst. Doing so allows the healing to work, even if you did not qualify to gain healing. For example undead may get healing from spells that specifically prohibit it.</p>
			<p class="indent">Through a Bonus Action you can establish or break the connection to this gem.</p>
			<p class="indent">Each time you use the effects of this gem to gain healing, remove the amount healed from the maximum amount this gem may hold. The maximum amount restores at dusk.</p>

	<element name="Lamp of Alhazred" type="Magic Item" source="Homebrew (Jonny)" id="ID_HB_JONNY_ITEM_MAGIC_LAMP_OF_ALHAZRED">		
		<description>
			<p>This odd stone lantern seems out of place no matter where it is located. When lit in a dark area, the light it casts on any wall reveals visionary windows to other times and places. If no time and place is chosen when the lamp is lit, a random one manifests. The viewed location must have a surface of at least comparable size for the window to appear on. This window is two-way, but does not allow travel. If creatures viewed can traverse the distance on their own, however (such as via <em>teleportation</em>), they might investigate the lampâ€™s subject. The chosen subject can be in the future or the past and at any location, although the location is accurate only to within 100 miles and the time is accurate only to within 10 years. The lamp can be used once per hour by burning 1 pint of oil. Extinguishing the lamp closes the window. If fuel remains and the lamp is activated once more, it shows nothing unusual.</p>
			<p>A new window cannot be opened until the lamp has burned for 1 hour total, using up the entirety of its fuel. Extinguishing the lantern and adding a new pint of oil to refuel it is required before the lantern can open another window.</p>

			<p class="indent">If you die while wearing the helm, your soul enters it, unless it already houses a soul. You can remain in the helm or depart for the afterlife. As long as your soul is in the helm, you can telepathically communicate with any creature wearing it. A wearer can't prevent this telepathic communication.</p>
